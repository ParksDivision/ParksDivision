## Hello there! 

I'm a full-stack software engineer based in Austin, Texas, with several years of experience in application development. My background in the entertainment industry brings a creative perspective to engineering and has taught me to tackle problems from different angles. I'm naturally curious and always looking to learn new things, which helps me balance attention to detail with delivering quality results on time. This diverse experience has been valuable whether I'm working independently or as part of a team, and I'm excited to bring these skills to a new opportunity. Feel free to take a look at some of my work and let me know what you think, thank you!
